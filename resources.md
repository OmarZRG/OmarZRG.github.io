## Mushroom Stuff

**[Aloha Medicinals' "Media List"](alohaculturebank.com/media/media-list.html) -** This is a great reference for many agar media recipes used to culture fungi. The naming scheme can get a little strange, but this is the most complete and concise collection of media recipes for mycology that I have found yet. Don't be overwhelmed by the 100+ recipes in this list, because if you don't know for sure that a given species needs something very specific like fish flakes and beeswax (?!), a basic malt extract or potato-dextrose agar will probably work fine. But when something isn't growing great, this list is a great starting point for experimentation. The solution to stalled transfers can be as simple as the addition of a small amount of a supplemental nutrient to the media, so it'll be easier for your sanity and for your cultures if you don't change the media recipe too drastically between transfers. You can 'Ctrl+F' the page to quickly find recipes that use the same base nutrient as the previous round of plates which should give some ideas of variations to try.
