## Mushroom Stuff


* **[Aloha Medicinals' "Media List"](alohaculturebank.com/media/media-list.html) -** This is a great reference for many agar media recipes used to culture fungi. The naming scheme can get a little strange, but this is the most complete and concise collection of media recipes for mycology that I have found yet. Don't be overwhelmed by the 100+ recipes in this list, because if you don't know for sure that a given species needs something very specific like fish flakes and beeswax (?!), a basic malt extract or potato-dextrose agar will probably work fine. But when something isn't growing great, this list is a great starting point for experimentation. The solution to stalled transfers can be as simple as the addition of a small amount of a supplemental nutrient to the media, so it'll be easier for your sanity and for your cultures if you don't change the media recipe too drastically between transfers. You can 'Ctrl+F' the page to quickly find recipes that use the same base nutrient as the previous round of plates which should give some ideas of variations to try.

* **[Data from my Grain Hydration Experiments](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12zSVWOdK2WwXnLxhFyFHacfesYClgmbh5c0tmBJpMyg/edit?usp=sharing) -** I've been working on quantifying the water content of grains prepared in various ways in order to develop protocols that can be used to consistently prepare a given type of grain with a range of possible moisture contents. This spreadsheet currently allows one to analyze and plan batches of grain by calculating a few important variables, and may be useful as a template for some. The estimated dry weight of the fresh grain is derived from the weight of fresh grain used and its initial water content. The dry weight combined with the total batch weight after soaking and straining gives an initial water content percentage, which can be used to determine how much additional water should be added before sterilization to hit the target moisture content. The final moisture content is verified by taking the contents of a sterilized bag from the batch, desiccating it in an oven (I will post the protocol for this at some point), and inputting its initial and dried weights. The spreadsheet also estimates the effect of adding water post-sterilization via liquid culture inoculation.
