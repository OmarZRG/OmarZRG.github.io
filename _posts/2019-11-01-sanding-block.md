title: "I May Have Invented a New Kind of Sanding Block (and a Quick Update on the Hydroponics Project)"

I finished sanding all the wood parts of the hydroponic system today, which was mostly taken care of with a random orbital sander. However framing lumber typically comes with nice rounded corners, which definitely makes the lives of construction and lumber yard workers easier, but also makes them a pain to sand fully. Obviously, all it takes to sand those corners and clean up splintery cuts is a sheet of sandpaper and some time to kill, but I'm already worried about getting tendonitis in my hands so I decided to do what I could to cut down on the manual labor. The result took a couple of hours to design in Fusion and another five hours to print in PLA with a 0.2mm layer height:

Aside from the printed parts (using about $1 in filament), the materials consist of just four M3-0.5 x 6 mm socket head screws and matching hex nuts (about $1.50 from Home Depot), which get pressed into nut traps and sit just shy of the sanding surface. The sanding block is the same width as common 3 2/3" x 9" sandpaper sheets, and the length of sandpaper needed is 4 1/2", which means you can just cut one of these sheets in half lengthwise and it's ready to use (larger 11" x 9" sheets could also be cut evenly to get pieces the same size). Then you just crease the sandpaper around the profile of the sanding block, place the clamp pieces in place, and punch the screws through the sandpaper and tighten them down.

This tool makes it really quick and easy to sand the existing corners on framing lumber and to clean up cut edges in a consistent way, while also being super ergonomic compared to sanding fully by hand. I didn't find any similar sanding blocks for sale in a cursory internet search, and this design would be super cheap and easy to adapt to injection molding (so if you're reading this and you work for a manufacturer of sanding blocks it's patent pending).

Anyway, I've now finished all the woodwork I need to do for this project, so next week it will be coated with outdoor polyurethane sealant and fully assembled. I should also be receiving most of the materials I have on order for this project next week, so in the mean time I will be finalizing the components that will let me mount the channels and plumb everything together.
