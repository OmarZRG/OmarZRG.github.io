Construction for the hydroponic system which will be the focus of my Div III research is well underway. The image above shows the frame mostly assembled for test fitting. This frame will provide a sturdy platform on which I can mount the channels that will hold the plant substrates, as well as the two nutrient solution reservoirs, pumps, and plumbing. At this point I have cut and drilled all the pieces and I have all the hardware I need, so the frame will be finalized as soon as I apply a polyurethane finish to the wood pieces to protect them from potential water damage.

As I've begun to design and build this system, I've made sure to choose materials and assembly steps that are robust, cost effective, and reproducible/maintainable. While this process has required much more thought than if I had simply slapped something together, I think it has been worth it for a couple of reasons. For one, I am well aware of the impact of completed academic projects, which either need to be thrown away when the project is finished or used and maintained by other students down the line. Therefore, I opted to take the time to design this setup to be easily disassembled for maintenance or modifications in the future, or if necessary for disposal/recycling. While using mostly impermanent fasteners added some time and expense to the project, I think this type of consideration is very important and should always be encouraged by advisors and grant reviewers at Hampshire. The other reason for this approach is to enable the design to be easily reproducible and scalable. This is because, although this is mainly a science project, I am also very concerned with the applicability of my research to real-world industries. Therefore I am looking to establish control conditions that closely mimic a real-world urban agriculture scenario, which thankfully implies an environment that is basically as controlled as what I can realistically establish in this experiment. This means that I not only have the opportunity to investigate a real-world issue, but also to produce a demonstrably viable "product" in terms of an efficient and scalable approach to growing leafy greens hydroponically.

I will expand more in the future about the philosophical and business considerations that I am taking as I plan out the rest of my Div, but the bottom line with this project so far is that it requires nothing that isn't readily available, and could probably be built in half an hour with some jigs set up. As a part of my goal to make this setup easy to maintain/modify and reproduce, I will be writing up a full build guide soon that will explain the fabrication process and the design decisions that went into it.

### Next Steps

I am already working on designing the components that will allow two 10" wide NFT ([nutrient film technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrient_film_technique)) channels to mount side-by-side above the frame. Since this technique is fairly sensitive to the levelness and incline angle of the channels, I am designing end caps and support mechanisms that will allow me to easily adjust the height at each corner of the channels. As I work on prepping and finishing the wood pieces with a polyurethane sealant, I will also be making these components and ordering the rest of the things I need to get this system up and running. Once I've finalized the frame, mounted the channels, and acquired the rest of the materials, I will be ready to mount the water pumps and put together the plumbing. I will also need to hang the grow light and put up an enclosure around the growing area to make the system ready to seed, but these steps will be trivial thanks to the shelving unit setup I'm using. At this point I'll be ready to sow seeds and do a test run, during which I will be setting up a system of sensors to record environmental variables during the experimental phase of the project.
