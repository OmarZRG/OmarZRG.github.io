Over the last few weeks, I've been coordinating an extracurricular workshop-style class centered around practical mushroom cultivation. So far I have met at least once weekly with a group of other students to plan and prepare for projects. At this point we've gathered cultures and specimens of around a dozen different species of gourmet and medicinal mushrooms between us, which we have been working to culture expand on agar plates. Some of the specimens we've cloned through tissue culture can be seen above, with domesticated strains on the right and local wild specimens on the left. We have now had a chance to transfer most of our cultures enough to be confident that they are pure, and have begun to expand them into liquid cultures. As the liquid cultures become colonized over the next couple of weeks, we will begin to transfer them to grain-based substrates from which we can expand the cultures further onto the substrates that they will fruit from.

As we continue our cultivation process, we'll be working on renovating the mushroom greenhouse that I built last year and constructing at least one more small greenhouse to enable us to establish multiple fruiting climates. We'll also be deciding on some simple experiments to conduct with substrate mixtures and other cultivation parameters as we attempt to grow our more exotic species.
